# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe
Where Should I Go ?
 # Overview:
   - Tic-Tac-Toe is a multiplayer game. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. 
 # Rules: 
   - This game has a 3X3 square matrix board where players have an option to either enter a 'X' or 'O' symbol in the given tiles.
   - The first player, who shall be designated "X", has 3 possible strategically distinct positions to mark during the first turn. Superficially, it might seem that there are 9 possible positions, corresponding to the 9 squares in the grid. Player X can win or force a draw from any of these starting marks; (however, playing the corner gives the opponent the smallest choice of squares which must be played to avoid losing).
   - The second player, who shall be designated "O", must respond to X's opening mark in such a way as to avoid the forced win.
   - The squared tiles should be properly marked so as not to let the opponent to form a triplet.
   - If any one one among Player1 and Player2 suceeds in forming a triplet then he/she wins the game.
